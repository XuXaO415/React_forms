React controls:
    What is shown (the value of the component)
    What happens [when] the user types (this is kept in state)
    What is displayed

    Input elements controlled in this way are called "controlled components"

    Since value attribute is set on element, displayed value will always be fullName - making the React state the "source of truth"

Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

You can validate a form as a user types

With a controlled component every state mutation will have an associate handler function. This makes it easy to modify or validate user input.
